# Guide: How to Share Lease Templates for Replication

## Overview

To accurately replicate your 3 types of lease agreements in the system, I need to see the exact format, structure, and content of your current lease templates.

---

## 3 Lease Types

Based on the system configuration, you have:

1. **Commercial Lease** (`lease_type: commercial`)
2. **Residential Lease - Micro** (`lease_type: residential_micro`)
3. **Residential Lease - Major** (`lease_type: residential_major`)

## Method 1: Share PDF/Word Documents (Recommended)

### Step 1: Locate Your Templates

Find the current lease templates you're using (PDF, Word, or printed copies).

### Step 2: Upload to Cloud Storage

Upload the templates to a file-sharing service:

**Options:**
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- OneDrive
- WeTransfer
- Direct file upload via chat (if supported)

### Step 3: Share Links

Share the links with me in this chat:

```
Commercial Lease Template: [Your Google Drive Link]
Residential Micro Template: [Your Google Drive Link]
Residential Major Template: [Your Google Drive Link]
```

## Method 2: Take Screenshots

If you only have printed copies or can't share files:

### Step 1: Take Clear Photos/Screenshots

- Take photos or screenshots of EVERY page of each lease type
- Ensure text is clearly readable
- Include headers, footers, and all sections

### Step 2: Share Images

Upload images to an image hosting service:
- Imgur.com
- ImgBB.com
- Or paste directly in chat if supported

## Method 3: Type Out Structure

If you can't share files, provide the structure:

### Example Format:

```
